          <h2>Magic Fairy Tales</h2>
          <p>Magic Fairy Tales is a free app available on Google Play and App Store. It is made as a digital tool for school  when teaching how to read and write.<p>
          <p>It always creates a new unique beginning of a new fairy tale no one has ever read before. Emojis inspire the users to learn by using their own imagination and continue the tale with their own language.<p>

          <h2>LikeToLearn</h2>
          <p>LikeToLearn is an educational concept. It shows a way to build a digital tool that lets children and their teachers use
           their own creativity.<p>
          <p>The kids can make "money" by doing their homework. For that "money" they can buy things in a game and build an own civilization.<p>
          <p>The teacher can be creative by presenting questions that are suitable for their pedagogic and their lessons.<p>

          <h2>Game for homework on the go</h2>
          <p>There are clear links between physical activity and performance at school.
            But how do we inspire pupils to exercise more? As part of an equal health research project being run by Malmö University,
            Jenny has been a part in developing a mobile app that can get pupils to do their homework while also exercising outdoors.<p>

        <h2>Programming course for unaccompanied refugees</h2>
         <p> Young people who have moved to Sweden independently face many challenges when it comes to education and job seeking.
              At the same time, there is a major need for talented programmers in the technology industry – both in Sweden and elsewhere.
              That is why Jenny took initiativ to offer a course on simple game programming.<p>
