        <h2>Programming course</h2>
         <p> Young people who have moved to Sweden independently face many challenges when it comes to education and job seeking.
              At the same time, there is a major need for talented programmers in the technology industry â€“ both in Sweden and elsewhere.
              That is why Jenny took initiativ to offer a course on simple game programming.
